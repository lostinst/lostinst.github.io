<p>TRek‚Äôd is a Star Trek parody fan film project in production since December 2015. A trailer was released in 2016, and now after a little over one year on hiatus, the production is moving out of dry dock, and is now finally at full impulse power.</p>

<h3 id="the-production-team">The Production Team</h3>

<p>Helming the project is writer, director, producer, and artist <strong>Da Han</strong>. An avid Star Trek enthusiast from Hollywood, CA., Da Han directed one of the earliest Star Trek fan films produced, helping pave the way for a new generations of sci fi fan filmmakers to embark on similar creative journeys inspired in the same way he was to pursue filmmaking as a career.</p>

<p>Fast forward to present day China, and Da Han is introducing Trek oriented filmmaking to China in a way that fans here can not only understand Trek as a viewer, but experience the filmmaking and creative process of making a Trek related film of their own.</p>

<p>Our cinematographer <strong>Amitesh</strong>, hails from Mumbai, India and is a presently a designer with Mercedes Benz here in Beijing.</p>

<p>Our Sound engineer and all around production coordinator / co-producer <strong>CrazyEMH</strong>, is a regular Scotty. Newly graduated, Sid‚Äôs job is hardware engineer. We‚Äôre not sure yet if he‚Äôll act in the show but we‚Äôre hoping to see Sid on screen somewhere‚Ä¶or at least on audio.</p>

<p><strong>Martin B√§hr</strong>, a software engineer from Germany, now residing in Beijing, is a major Trek aficionado and contributor as well as a co-producer, and actor on TReK‚Äôd.</p>

<h3 id="character-byline">Character byline</h3>

<p>Martin portrays the character of Lt. Horatio.</p>

<p>Since childhood Horatio has dreamed of taking the center seat as a Star Captain, yet the fate of his reality has placed him in a seat in front of a desk, and as nothing more than a mediocre museum ship curator. Fortunately (or unfortunately), this museum happens to be the retired Enterprise. Knowing its not an operational ship, Horatio‚Äôs sense of pride is false at best in front of his son.</p>

<h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>

<p>It was a usual mediocre day and Horatio leaves for the museum on a routine inspection. It was a few days before the anniversary of the battle of Wolf 359. The ceremony was to be held on board the now repurposed ship/museum. High-level officers and new students who have just entered Star fleet Academy, will be gathered there for the opening ceremony. Horatio as a curator, is anxious yet confident that everything will go according to plan. And why not‚Ä¶its just a party.</p>

<p>Horatio is a family guy, stubborn, old school, never uses Transporters, and instead uses the outdated and somewhat slow space elevator to work on the ship, even though the elevator is much slower. Horatio is at best a Walter Mitty nostalgic arm chair historian.</p>

<p>Completing part of the days work, he takes a break to drink earl grey tea, but when the cup makes an abnormal sound, and the ship begins to shake. Horatio is at a loss. And unlike his dream as a captain wth an adventurous career, Horatio is a curator, and becuase he has become so accustomed to a mundane routine career, when things go awry he is as confused as the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>Unprepared‚Ä¶with a makeshift crew of students and tourists, Horatio is forced to embark on a trip to points unknown‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Ultimately, Horatio discovers the reasons why the ship unexpectedly launches. But things become even more inexplicable as mysterious people board the ship. Soon landing parties are sent to a nearby planet to investigate the source behind all the mysterious activities they encounter‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs only the beginning of many more wacky and mind numbing Sci Fi stories to follow‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="current-shooting-progress">Current Shooting Progress</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre very grateful to the actors involved in the early portion of shooting over a year ago, including <strong>Jade</strong>, <strong>Shook</strong>, etc., etc., As a result we have usable ship footage, but we need more footage to round out our story. That‚Äôs how you can help.</p>

<h3 id="progress-to-the-present">Progress to the present</h3>

<p>Thus far the main portion of the story has been shot, with plans to debut as a two part pilot episode. This allows us to screen publicly the first half, to thank all who participated in the early portion of shooting, we also need everyone‚Äôs help. And to make the story a cliff hanger, now we need your help to make this story complete‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="help-us-by-recording-webcam-videos">Help us by recording webcam videos</h2>

<p>Yes, now you can become part of our production by using any old webcam or cellphone to make a selfie video.</p>

<p>We have relative story material, but in order to make the content more substantial, we urge everyone to join our production by recording videos of YOU for us. NO acting required. In fact we want you to just be YOU.</p>

<h3 id="style-and-tone">Style and tone</h3>

<p>Many of you have seen captain‚Äôs logs, and the first officer‚Äôs log etc., but Star Trek rarely portrays a normal crew members‚Äô daily work, we intend to insert this into the main storyline.</p>

<p>Usually the communication between crew are mostly audio-based (off screen), but we wondered why not video calls? Its the future‚Ä¶imagine the feeling of being lost in space far far away from home, walking in a starship corridor with a selfie stick ‚Ä¶what would you say and think. Would you laugh, would you cry, be silly, sing, rap, attempt to solve technical ship related issues, or just complain? Who would you call?</p>

<p><strong>Record video in the form of a crew log or video call.</strong> Just face the phone / computer camera, speak and record.</p>

<p>The background can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure white / green (green curtain) wall, so that we can be process it later as if you are in the corridor, crew quarters and so on.</li>
  <li>Of course, if you can not find a white or green wall, then any solid background will also work. Light or dark background if you need to shoot from your school dorm room. We welcome you to play with your own imagination, think of all the places you could be on a starship, Make sure you don‚Äôt have things seen in frame that reflect today‚Äôs era (unless you establish yourself as a 21st century vintage retro lover). Anything you can do to make it easier for us to use and process easier will probably ensure you get more screen time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sets">Sets</h3>

<p>In correlation with our episode‚Äôs storyline, you have these <strong>roles to choose</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Museum staff</li>
  <li>Ordinary tourists, with no knowledge of actual Star fleet protocol.</li>
  <li>Star Fleet Academy students</li>
  <li>Star Fleet staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Use your imagination‚Ä¶in the Star Trek Universe anything is possible and any kind of cosplay character is ok. Or just be YOU.</p>

<h4 id="general-crew-description">General crew description</h4>

<p>There are many of you who hope to work on a star ship but your Star Fleet grade is so low that you can only compromise by taking a job cleaning Enterprise‚Äôs decks or by working as a tour guide etc‚Ä¶.but you‚Äôre still excited to be there. Many of you know Star Ship and Star fleet history and technology intrinsically, but only from a text book perspective.</p>

<h4 id="the-look-and-feel">The look and feel</h4>

<p>Clothes / uniforms or makeup should ideally match your selected role, race, type of work and so on‚Ä¶but you can be more creative if it makes sense and is well‚Ä¶funny.</p>

<h3 id="order-of-events-within-the-storyline">Order of events within the storyline</h3>

<p>Chronologically, the log recordings / video calls occur as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start of the work day.</strong> You are just starting work. Maybe you missed breakfast and are thinking about trivial issues, promotions, and classmate rumors.</li>
  <li><strong>The commanding officer and curator, Horatio arrives.</strong> Things become serious. No more goofing around.</li>
  <li><strong>The ship leaves dry dock, and is out of control.</strong> You feel fear / madness / any emotion‚Ä¶or maybe no emotion if you‚Äôre part Vulcan LOL.</li>
  <li><strong>The ship is controlled by unknown forces and is moving somewhere.</strong> You feel uncertainty, fear, doubt that the captain (Horatio) does not know what to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Being boarded (who boarded the ship?).</strong> You can refer to something like Q who likes to play with and control other people‚Äôs minds. Here our visitors‚Äôs names are The Cowboy, and Pepe, Whether or not to use these specific names is your choice. Maybe you don‚Äôt know their names yet.)</li>
  <li><strong>Beam down to planet.</strong> After a red shirt investigation, a box is discovered (at this time you do not know what it is). You will probably only know that it‚Äôs a box left behind by a crazy scientist who uses this box to control minds, is smaller than Landru and more hyper A.I. We won‚Äôt show you the box yet but you can guess what it looks like. Only a few of the commanders know. You‚Äôre hearing mostly here say and rumors.</li>
</ol>
