Starting a new podcast category now where we post after shows during [TReK&#39;d](http://trekin.space/call_for_videos_en/) production, as it&#39;s now back to warp speed after some resource problem and the C&amp;D from CBS/Paramount.

This is the first _Ready Room_ episode, recorded just after we done a script read through. Raise your blue little antennas and subscribe for more _Ready Room_ episodes, and, the release of our audio drama!

BTW we welcome any help you can offer, if you want to join the production just contact the feedback email below.

Recorded on 20180623, hosts: Martin\|Da Han\|CrazyEMH
