## What, who, where, and when is TReK’d?

TRek'd is a Star Trek parody fan film project. After a one year hiatus, the production is finally moving past dry dock, and is now at full impulse power.

[Watch trailer online](https://v.qq.com/x/page/h0191mq0dhl.html)

The director, Da Han who is a very talented Star Trek enthusiast from Hollywood, CA., in the U.S.A. directed one of the earliest Star Trek fan films. And He has now made it a goal to introduce Trek oriented filmmaking to China so that fans here can not only understand Trek as a viewer, but experience the filmmaking and creative process of making a Trek related film as well.

Martin, a software engineer from Germany, is a major Trek aficionado and contributor now residing in Beijing. In Trek'd Martin plays the character of Lt. Horatio. Since childhood Horatio has dreamed of taking the center seat as a Star Captain, yet the fate of his reality has placed him in a seat in front of a desk and as nothing more than a mediocre museum ship curator. Fortunately (or unfortunately), this museum happens to be the retired Enterprise. Knowing its not an operational ship, Horatio’s sense of pride is false at best in front of his son.

It was a usual mediocre day and Horatio leaves for the museum on a routine inspection. It was a few days before the anniversary of the battle of Wolf 359. The ceremony was to be held on board the museum. High-level officers and new students who have just entered Starcraft Academy, will be gathered there for the opening ceremony. Horatio as a curator, is anxious yet confident that everything will go according to plan. And why not…its just a party.

Horatio is a family guy, stubborn, old school, never uses Transporters, and instead uses the outdated and somewhat slow space elevator to work on the ship, even though the elevator is much slower. Horatio is at best a Walter Mitty nostalgic arm chair historian.

Completing part of the days work, he takes a break to drink earl grey tea, but when the cup makes an abnormal sound, and the ship begins to shake. Horatio is at a loss. And unlike his dream as a captain wth an adventurous career, Horatio is a curator, and becuase he has become so accustomed to a mundane routine career, when things go awry he is as confused as the rest of the crew.

Unprepared…Horatio is forced to embark on a trip to points unknown…

## Current Shooting Progress

We’re very grateful to the actors involved in the early portion of shooting over a year ago, including Jade, Shook, etc., etc., As a result we’ve progressed to the present. We apologize for using "etc" and not listing all the people who have contributed this far, (CrazyEMH who does a wonderful podcast just joined us), and is now responsible for behind the scenes work.

Thus far the main portion of the story has been shot and the episode will be released as a two part pilot episode. So while we intend to screen publically the first half to thank all who participated in the early portion of shooting, **we also need everyone's help**.

Horatio ultimately discovers the reasons why the ship unexpectedly launches, and why mysterious people board the ship, and the ship finally parks in a planet bound orbit, with landing parties sent to the planet to investigate and find the real initiator behind all the mysterious activities they encounter…but that’s only the beginning of many more wacky and mind numbing Sci Fi stories to follow….

But now we need your help to make this story complete…

## Please Help Us by Recording Short Videos

Yes, any old webcam or cellphone selfie video.

We have relative story material, but in order to make the content more substantial, we urge everyone to join our production by recording videos of YOU for us. NO acting required. In fact we want you to just be YOU.

### Style

Many of you have seen captain's logs, and the first officer's log etc., but Star Trek rarely shows the normal crew members' daily work, we intend to insert this into the main storyline.

Usually the communication between crew are mostly audio-based (touch the chest for the communicator), but we wondered why not video calls? Imagine the feeling of walking in the starship corridor with a selfie stick ...

**Record video in the form of a crew log or video call.** Just face the phone / computer camera and act, the background can be:

* Pure white / green (green curtain) wall, so that we can be process it later as if you are in the corridor, crew quarters and so on;
* Of course, if you can not find a white or green wall, then any solid background will also work. We welcome you to play with your own imagination, think of all the places you could be on a starship, Make sure you do not have things seen in frame that reflect today's era (unless you establish yourself as a 21st century vintage retro lover). Anything you can do to make it easier for us to use immediately and avoid green screen processing will probably ensure you get more screen time. 

### Sets

In correlation with our episodes storyline, you have these roles to choose:

* Museum staff
* Ordinary tourists, with no knowledge of actual starfleet protocol.
* Star Fleet Acadamy students
* Star Fleet staff
* use your imagination, any other characters that meet the story is ok.

There are many of you who hope to work on a star ship but your Star Fleet grade is so low that you can only compromise by taking a job cleaning Enterprise's decks or a tour guide etc….but you’re still excited to be there. Of course you would be.

Clothes / uniforms or makeup should ideally match the selected role, race, type of work and so on…but you can be creative if it makes sense and is well…funny.

Chronologically, the log recordings / video calls occur as follows:

1. Start the day of work (museum staff) / just started to visit the museum (visitors)
2. The curator Horatio arrives and things become serious. No more goofing around.
3. The ship leaves dry dock, and is out of control, you feel fear / madness / any emotion…or maybe no emotion if you’re part vulcan LOL.
4. The ship is controlled by unknown forces and is moving somewhere, uncertainty, fear, the captain (Horatio) does not know what to do.
5. Being boarded (who boarded the ship? You can refer to something like Q who likes to play with and control other people's minds. Here visitors’s name is The Cowboy and Pepe, Whether or not to use this specific name is your choice. Maybe you don’t know their names yet.)
6. Beam down to planet, after a red shirt investigation, a box is discovered (at this time you do not know what it is. if you really want to know what this is - after it is found the only thing you will probably know is that it’s a box left behind by a crazy scientist who uses this box to control minds, is smaller than Landru and more hyper A.I. We won’t show you the box yet but you can guess what it looks like. Only a few of the commanders know. You are hearing mostly here say and rumors.)
